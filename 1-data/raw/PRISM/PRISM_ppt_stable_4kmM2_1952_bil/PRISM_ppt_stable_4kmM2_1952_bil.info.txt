PRISM_DATASET_REMARKS: This grid was developed in three steps:  (1) precipitation was initially modeled with PRISM at 30-arc-second (~800-m) resolution for each month of the year to produce the source grids listed under PRISM_FILENAME, on the date(s) listed under PRISM_CREATE_DATE; (2) these twelve 800-m grids were upscaled to 2.5-arc-minute (~4-km) resolution with a Gaussian filter; and (3) the resulting twelve 4-km grids were summed to obtain a 4-km annual precipitation grid.
